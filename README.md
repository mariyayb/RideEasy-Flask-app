# Flask app: RideEasy
## A tool for motorcycle sellers

A Flask app where the a potential seller of a used motorcycle on Ebay inputs certain details of their 30-day fixed price listing and receives a probability that the listing will end in a successful sale. The output also includes the top 3 features (via LIME) that influence this probability. 

The probability is not returned as a number but as "low", "borderline (moderate)" or "high".
